You can't go back, but you don't need to.

This opens up passages north, south, east and down.

> n

An awe flame distracts you from everything else.

> off lame (1)

You now have a keen-eye key nigh. But you sense you need something to go with it.

Also, a passage will open east if you leave and come back. But you're still distracted at the moment. So why not explore elsewhere?

Slime apps here.

They aren't obvious, but when you use the key to piece them together, you get something ...

Also, you can't navigate a cramp/ache ramp, yet.

The aid art ...

You are squirted with "Oi, LOSE" oil-ooze. Oh no!

Oh no! A thief lord!

> the floored (1)

"Thee floored" also works.

Now the meek "owed, me" code is a manifesto for a giant heist robbery. But of whom? And where?

Oh wait! The passage in leads somewhere new ...

In the self-arm cell/farm, a call to action ...
